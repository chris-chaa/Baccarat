Some challenges I encountered while creating this code were trying to figure out how to combine the game and turtle itself to create a functioning graph and creating markers at the same time as a win is shown. I overcame this by just creating an if -statement instead of multiple for statements. Overall, I had fun creating this little project through what I learned in this class.
